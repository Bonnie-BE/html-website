        <p>All that we do is possible because of all the support we receive, from our donors to volunteers and the fundraising events that we host throughout the year.

If you are interested in joining our team and want to offer your services to us and be a volunteer please click this link, <a href = "#">Volunteering</a>. We have two to three fundraising events in a year, the first one usually around February, the second one around August, and the third one in November, these events have contributed greatly in the NGO and we will continue to host them because of all the support and love we receive.</p>
